Synopsis: Student Grade Management System
Objectives:
- To provide an efficient way of entering and managing student grades.
- To calculate and display key statistics such as average, highest, and lowest grades.
- To enable filtering of students by pass/fail status.
- To sort students based on their grades for easy comparison.
Scope:
This system will include grade entry, data storage, statistical analysis, and filtering options. Key features
include:
- Grade Entry: Input student grades along with subject details.
- Statistical Calculations: Display of average grades, highest, and lowest scores for individual students
and the entire class.
- Filtering and Sorting: Option to filter students based on pass/fail status and sort students by grades.
Methodology:
The system will be developed using a simple, phased approach, starting with requirement gathering and
design, followed by implementation using Python or JavaScript. The back-end will handle data storage
and statistical analysis, while the front-end will offer an intuitive user interface. After development, the
system will undergo testing and be deployed for user feedback.
Expected Outcomes:
The system will reduce manual errors, save time, and provide valuable insights into student
performance, making grade management more efficient and data-driven.
